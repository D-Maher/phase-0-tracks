What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?

The purpose of the HTML5 semantic tags is to provide a sort of "labeled skeleton" for the webpage, and they serve to break up the page into certain types of section. Adding this semantic structure is useful because it allows for a specific CSS style for each specific section. I would say the most useful semantic tags are <main>, <header>, <footer>, and <section>. These tags break up the page into a sort of beginning, middle, and end (with <section> tags as the "chapters").

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?

The browser displays the <header> at the very top of the page, the <footer> at the very bottom, and the <main> in the middle (i.e. focal point) of the page.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?

I learned that Sublime comes with a few built-in snippets, some more useful than others. More importantly, however, I learned how to craft snippets in Sublime! That is so cool! Once I identify certain patterns in the setup of webpages, I'll be sure to implement snippets to offer shortcuts.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?

The most difficult concept to grasp for me was when exactly to use each semantic tag. From what my GPS guide, Peter, told me, there really is no consensus on the best practice for these tags. I am sure with time, I'll nail down my own preferences for using such tags.
