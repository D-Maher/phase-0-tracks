    <h1> This is a big ole heading. </h1>
    <h2> Hello world! </h2>
    <p>Right here we have a paragraph - sure is neat! One of the words in this paragraph lifts considerably more than any other word in the paragraph... One might say he is the <strong>strongest</strong>.</p>
    <p>This is a second paragraph. One of the words in this paragraph likes to <em>lean</em> a bit to one side.</p>
    <h3>Whoa! Here comes a list!</h3>
    <h4>Things to notice about this list...</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>It's an <em>unordered</em> list.</li>
        <li>There are bullets not numbers present.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Oh man here comes another list!</h3>
    <h4>Things to notice about this list...</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>It's an <em>ordered</em> list</li>
        <li>There are numbers not bullets present.</li>
    </ol>
    Last but not least, here's a picture of my favorite <a href="https://gifts.worldwildlife.org/gift-center/Images/large-species-photo/large-Duck-billed-Platypus-photo.jpg">animal</a>.
