What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

    The Linux philosophy stems, in part, from the Unix philosophy, which, in general, assumes that the user is computer literate. In other words, Linux assumes that the user knows what he or she is doing, and therefore allows the user to do as they please (be it bad or good). Linux offers the user many tools to accomplish any given task, but as far as design philosophy goes, keeping things as simple as possible, with each "thing" designated to a particular task, is the best way to go.


In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

    A virtual private server (VPS) is essentially a remote computer, complete with its own operating system, that exists only in imagination (i.e. virtually). This remote computer can take the form of/occupy a chunk of memory that is able to carry out basic functions that any computer would be able to carry out. An advantage to using a VPS is the ability to experiment and test different ideas without needing to worry about any negative repercussions on one's own machine. This is possible because a VPS exists as a standalone entity, separate from any user's physical machine. Additionally, VPSs can be easily configured to suit a user's needs; this makes VPSs very useful and versatile.


Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

    This is considered a bad idea because it leaves your entire system vulnerable. Changes made while logged in as the root user could have unexpected and often negative impacts on files or programs in the rest of the Linux system. Even worse, the system will not warn you if you want to perform a certain task that could wreak havoc; it will automatically let you do anything. As a result, logging as the root user should be done with the utmost caution and typically only when trying to carry out administrative tasks on the system.
