jQuery Exploration Plan:

    * Google "Intro to jQuery" to get a synopsis of what jQuery is like
        - take notes on overall jQuery principles

    * Locate a docs page for jQuery and bookmark it for further reference
        - particularly docs that show concrete examples

    * Google "jQuery tutorial" to see if there are any resources that allow me to experiment with jQuery from the browser

    * Stop researching and try a bit of jQuery on my own

    * Time permitting, look up jQuery best practices for helpful tips on working with jQuery effectively

    * Use the Pomodoro technique (25 min. of work, 5 min. break) while researching jQuery
