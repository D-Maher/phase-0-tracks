Helping My Personal Robot Operate an Elevator

- First, before going anywhere near the elevator:
    + Await input from me via Wi-Fi for the desired floor number
- Upon entering close proximity to the elevator:
    + Take note of current floor (posted near elevator)
    + Press button outside elevator corresponding to desired direction of travel:
        * If desired floor number is greater than current floor number:
            - Press "up" button
        * If desired floor number is less than current floor number:
            - Press "down" button
        * Otherwise:
            - Do not press any buttons, you are on the correct floor you silly, silly robot.
- Once appropriate elevator doors are open:
    + Wait for those exiting the elevator to clear out 
    + Enter elevator
- Once inside elevator:
    + Move towards floor selection panel
    + Press button corresponding to floor number matching my previous input
    + Enjoy elevator ride
